"""The abilities that make a unit type which the game's own table does not name for it.

Hand-written, and never generated, so a new sweep of the tech tree keeps every entry. `tools/sweep_tech_tree.py` orders
each ability here in game, and `tools/generate_tech_tree.py` refuses to write the tech tree unless the sweep saw each
make its unit type, so a patch that breaks one stops the regeneration. `tests/test_gamedata.py` fails once the game's
table names an ability here for its type, and the entry can go.
